# mvc-tutorial
A MVC tutorial for beginners

## Status
I used the original tutorial to teach my apprentices the most important things.
E.g Most important Design Patterns. Each apprentice extended then the framework
with additional features. This document is now a mix/merge of the base tutorial
plus several enhancements. Because of this it could have several bugs which come
from merging all together.

## The Tutorial

The tutorial itself can be found here: https://modir.github.io/mvc-tutorial/

## Feedack
If you find any bugs or you have feedback please give them to me as issues.
I will then look at them and make it better.
